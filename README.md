1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Loading Data: The dataset is loaded, and initial inspection is done to understand its structure and remove duplicates.
Handling Missing Values: Missing values are addressed using forward-fill, ensuring data completeness.
Data Cleaning: Numeric columns are cleaned, and categorical features are encoded for model compatibility.

2. Feature Engineering and Target Variable
Feature Selection: Features are selected, and the target variable is defined.
Encoding: Categorical features and target labels are encoded into numerical values to facilitate model training.

3. Model Training and Evaluation
Model Selection: A RandomForestClassifier is chosen for its robustness and performance.
Model Training: The model is trained on the training set.
Model Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

4. Model Optimization
Grid Search: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Evaluation: The optimized model is evaluated for improved accuracy and performance metrics.

5. Feature Importance
Feature Importance: The importance of each feature is analyzed and visualized to understand their impact on predictions.

6. Predictions and Insights
New Data Predictions: The model is used to make predictions on new data, demonstrating its application.
